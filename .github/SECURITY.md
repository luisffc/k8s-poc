- **Non-root Containers**: All containers run as non-root users
- **Security Contexts**: Kubernetes security contexts enforced
- **Network Policies**: Network segmentation implemented
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets, proper secret handling

### Vulnerability Management
- **Automated Scanning**: Daily vulnerability scans in CI/CD
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly security reviews and assessments
- **Incident Response**: Documented incident response procedures

## Security Standards Compliance

- **OWASP Top 10**: Addressed through SAST and security practices
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Kubernetes security configurations
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security controls implementation

## Security Testing
